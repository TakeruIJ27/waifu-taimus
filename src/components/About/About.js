            <p>Waifu refers to a fictional character an anime fan considers a wife or husband. 
                There is a word for male characters female anime fans love: husbando. It is strange 
                that the online otaku culture adopted this word instead of the Japanese word hazu to
                refer to this relationship. In any case, sometimes waifu is used to refer to male 
                interests by female anime fans as well. The labels are not completely solid.

                So in any case, a waifu is a fictional character that a person loves. 
                It is a relationship that exists on a spectrum. Some people approach waifuism 
                ally. It is something fun and temporary. On the opposite end are those that take 
                the relationship seriously. They wear a wedding band to symbolize their marriage 
                with their waifu. They attempt to base their decisions on what their waifu would
                want. She is a real person that can feel disappointment, anger, or hurt
