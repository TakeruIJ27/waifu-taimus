            <p>Waifuism is a complex idea that some may find troubling. Waifuism is not 
            rooted in delusion or mental illness. Certainly, there are some people with these 
            issues in the communities, but on the whole people are rational. They simply love 
            and relate to a fictional character. Like all relationships (whether with an idea,
            a person, or even an object) there are few certainties. Relationships are defined 
            by the personalities involved. Fictional characters do have personalities that can
            serve as a guide as to how the character would think or behave in situations. 
            Really, this is what authors do when writing. They know the personality of their 
            characters and write how that character would react. Waifu enthusiasts do the same.

            Ideas have power. Fictional characters resonate. They can generate feelings of 
            triumph, love, hate, anger, lust, and every human emotion. Much of what we 
            consider human is an idea.  Think of the name of a friend, and a mental image 
            of that person will appear. That image is not the person, but our understanding 
            of that person. Waifuism is the same. A waifu is a mental image of a person that 
            happens not to be 3D.  The process is identical to what we do with 3D people and 
            relationships. Much of reality is based on interpretation handled in our minds. 
            We can sometimes gum up those mental gears and experience reality in its 
            unadulterated form, but for most of us, this is rare. Waifuism is a result of 
            normal (and not abnormal) workings of our mental machinery.</p>
